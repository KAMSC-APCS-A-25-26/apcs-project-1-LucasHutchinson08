    So this is a simulation of Golds Gym with a narrator acting as a personal trainer.
You are taken through different exercises pertaining to different muscle groups. Some of
the exercises have set amount of reps. However others use the rand method to display
a random amount of reps that you were able to perform. You are able to switch muscle groups
after performing a single exercise. Each muscle group is similarly stuctured in that they
both offer two different exercises.
